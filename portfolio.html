                <p id="bio">Anton Kogan grew up in Skokie, Illinois (where he felt he never quite fit in), and graduated from the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana(where he didn’t fit in either)
                He spent ten years working at the Chicago Board of Trade in the derivaties trading field, where he was a (much-abused, under-appreciated) trader in the Dow Jones Futures pit.
                After selling his membership (because he was done with the soulsucking financial industry) he worked as an Operations Manager for BridgeStreet Global Hospitality, a corporate housing provider (he had an office with a nice view, but still did not fit in).
                He currently lives in Chicago (where he feels like he fits in) with his wife.</p>
